# Get Started

Simple Sveltekit boilerplate with Tailwind CSS already set up. 
Just run `npm install` to download the dependencies. 

## Info
I use Tailwind in pretty much every project, and I got tired of setting it up every time. Now I just copy and rename this file, and it's ready to go. 

Everything is set to the default. If you want to make changes to the theme, follow the instructions in [Tailwind's documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme).
